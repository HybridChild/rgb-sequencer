# rgb-sequencer

**rgb-sequencer** is a `no_std`-compatible Rust library for controlling RGB LEDs through timed color sequences on embedded systems. Define multi-step animations with customizable durations, smooth linear or instant step transitions, and finite or infinite loop behavior, then let the lightweight sequencer engine handle the timing complexity while you focus on your application logic. Control multiple LEDs independently without heap allocation, making it perfect for resource-constrained devices running Embassy, RTIC, or bare-metal firmware.
