//! Time abstraction traits for platform-agnostic duration and instant types.
//!
//! These traits allow the sequencer to work with different timing systems
//! (Embassy, std::time, custom hardware timers, etc.) without being tied
//! to a specific implementation.
//!
//! Implementers should ensure their types handle time wrapping appropriately
//! for their platform's timer width (e.g., 32-bit vs 64-bit counters).
